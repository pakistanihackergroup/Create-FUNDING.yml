# Enable cryptocurrency in FUNDING.yml
This repository's purpose is to gather the interest that the community has in adding cryptocurrencies as an officially supported funding platform for GitHub Sponsors. Star this repo and send an email to support@github.com if you'd like to see cryptocurrencies added as official options in the `FUNDING.yml` file for GitHub Sponsors. We can show the social proof to GitHub, and I have great reason to believe they will respond positively. But please do something to help make this happen.
